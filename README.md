# Customer Churn Prediction for Bank Customers

## Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a bank based on customer behavior data. Techniques like SMOTE are used to handle class imbalance, and the model is evaluated using F1-score and ROC-AUC.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features such as:
- Geography
- Gender
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Credit Card Ownership
- Activity Status
- Salary
- Churn (Target variable)

## Model Development
- **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models were developed.
- **SMOTE** was applied to handle class imbalance.
- The models were evaluated based on F1-score and ROC-AUC.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jorge-Zavalza/customer-churn-prediction.git
